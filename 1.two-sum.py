# Testcase Example:  '[2,7,11,15]\n9'
#
# Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they
# add up to a specific target.
# 
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may
# not use the same element twice.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
# 
# Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
# return [0, 1].
#

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        list= []
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(n):
            x = target - nums[i]
            if x in nums and nums.index(x) != i:
                return [i, nums.index(x)]
